# Luminol
Luminol is an open sourced version of the RPG Maker XP editor created in Python.
Luminol's goal is to fully unlock RPG Maker XP by no longer limiting you with the editor.

Luminol is intended to be used with **mkxp**. It may not work with the standard game.exe.
(You really should if you're trying to push RPG Maker XP to its limits!)
If you are modding OneShot, you do NOT need to worry about this as OneShot uses mkxp.

## Dependencies
Luminol uses:
- [Kivy](https://pypi.org/project/Kivy/) for it's GUI.
- [Python Imaging Library](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) for rendering maps and sprites.
- [Ruby Marshal Module](https://pypi.org/project/rubymarshal/) for loading .rxdata. *(integrated into Luminol)*
- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) for speedy array manipulation.

## Installation
Something to do with venv I've not worked it out yet
